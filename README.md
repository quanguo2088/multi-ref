## Overview

Synthetic DNA is becoming a promising data storage medium for future large-scale data archiving. However, data readout from massive, unordered sequencing reads requires alignment based on overlapping regions and is complicated by diverse sequencing errors. We propose a multi-stage alignment and error correction strategy via multiple-fold hidden references, transforming the de novo readout into a resequencing-like workflow. We provide code for readout pipelines under different error conditions, divided into two main parts：

1. **Fast recovery**: In low-error-rate scenarios, the pipeline identifies reads via sliding correlation to watermark reference. Bit-wise consensus rapidly generates soft-decision information for LDPC decoding.
2. **Bootstrap recovery**: In the presence of indels, the pipeline progressively identifies reads with distinct features using multiple-fold references. The forward–backward algorithm (FBA) generates indel-corrected probability information for reliable readout.

The proposed scheme is compatible with next-generation sequencing (NGS) and Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) sequencing platforms (see [Summary of Datasets](docs/Summary%20of%20datasets.pdf)). We provide the complete source code and datasets used to generate the recovery results presented in this study
(see [Summary of Experiments](docs/Summary%20of%20experiments.pdf)).
